# Haskell Solar System

This miniproject was made as a part of my haskell learning journey.

It applies priciples of functional programming in a task of simulating a system of multiple bodies, interacting with each other according to Newton's law of universal gravitation.

Here are some cool pics showing what will happen to orbit of the Moon, if there was other planet nearby:

(Red dots are Earth and planets of various masses)

And here's an example of [gravitational slingshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist)
